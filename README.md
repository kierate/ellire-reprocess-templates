Ellire - deployment-specific configuration management
-----------------------------------------------------

Ellire simplifies deployment-specific configuration for your applications.

You define a single file with "macro" configuration for all different "profiles" your applications run in (e.g. dev,
test, staging, prod). Ellire can then process all "template" files where macros are used to generate the final files
relevant for the environment/deployment.
